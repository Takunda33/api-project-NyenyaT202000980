# api-project-NyenyaT202000980
This is a data driven api in which the customer posts reviews on the web interface and a prediction is made
to see whether it is a positive, neutral or negative sentiment. Before sending the review text to the machine learning model, the API preprocesses
it by converting the review text into numerical form. The API processes the text, uses the machine learning model to predict sentiment, and returns the result.
